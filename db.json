Using messages as the communication mechanism among different services allows more independence of the individual components that make up a larger system, thus enabling faster development, faster deployment, and additional scalability.  Introducing Persistent Messages further enhances the architecture to allow time independence as well.\n\nIn this talk we will look at the overall structure of an Event Driven Architecture, discuss the business and technical advantages, and review how to migrate an existing application to an Event Driven Architecture.  Brad will present his experiences in migrating an existing application to an Event Driven Architecture, talk about lessons learned along the way.\n\nIf you have a large legacy application you need to break into microservices, or you are involved in a Domain Driven Design project, this talk is for you.\n",

Now serverless is emerging as an even smaller component of the new way of building applications piece by piece.  In our zeal to adopt the latest in architectural approaches, have we given sufficient thought to where they are going or what comes next?\n<br/><br/>\nIf you are considering building an application with a microservice or serverless based architecture, come to this panel of experienced cloud developers and architects and learn what these technologies can do for you now, and what they will do in the future.  Ask our panel questions on what works, what doesn't, and how to prepare today for the technology that's coming next.",

Each service has its own private database that’s only accessible indirectly through the services API. Consequently, implementing queries and transactions that span multiple services is challenging. In this presentation, you will learn how to solve these distributed data management challenges using asynchronous messaging. I describe how to implement transactions using sagas, which are sequences of local transactions, coordinated using messages. You will learn how to implement queries using Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), which uses events to maintain replicas. I describe the key role that messaging plays a microservice architecture.",

          "description": "Successful applications have a habit of growing.  What’s more, the rate of growth increases over time because the development team typically gets larger. Eventually, the application will become extremely large and the organization ends up in monolithic hell. All aspects of development, testing and deployment are slow and painful. It’s impossible for the developers to keep up with the demands of the business. And, to make matters worse the application uses a technology stack that is increasingly obsolete.\n\nThe way to escape monolithic hell is to migrate to the microservice architecture. In this talk, you will learn about the essential characteristics of microservices. I describe the benefits and drawbacks  of the microservice architecture and when it makes sense to use it. You will learn about the design problems you will encounter when using microservices. I describe how to solve this problems by applying the microservices pattern language. You will learn how the microservice architecture accelerates the delivery of large, complex applications.\n",

Each service has its own private database that’s only accessible indirectly through the services API. Consequently, implementing queries and transactions that span multiple services is challenging. In this presentation, you will learn how to solve these distributed data management challenges using asynchronous messaging. I describe how to implement transactions using sagas, which are sequences of local transactions, coordinated using messages. You will learn how to implement queries using Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), which uses events to maintain replicas. I describe the key role that messaging plays a microservice architecture.",

Consequently, implementing queries and transactions that span multiple services is challenging. In this presentation, you will learn how to solve these distributed data management challenges using asynchronous messaging. I describe how to implement transactions using sagas, which are sequences of local transactions, coordinated using messages. You will learn how to implement queries using Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), which uses events to maintain replicas. I describe the key role that messaging plays a microservice architecture.",
